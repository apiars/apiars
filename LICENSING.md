# Licensing Policy

## 📄 Overview

## 🆓 Open Source License (AGPL-3.0)

### What You Can Do

✅ **Use** apiars freely for any purpose  
✅ **Modify** the source code

⚠️ **If you distribute or provide modified versions over a network:**
- You MUST provide complete source code to users
- You MUST license modifications under AGPL-3.0
