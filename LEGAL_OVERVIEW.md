## 1. License Summary

apiars is licensed under the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)**.

The AGPL-3.0 allows use, modification, and redistribution of the software,

subject to copyleft requirements.

### Key AGPL Obligation

If a modified version of apiars is provided to users over a network

(e.g. as a SaaS or hosted service), the complete corresponding source code

of the modified version must be made available to those users.

---

## 2. Permitted Uses (Under AGPL)

The following uses are permitted **without a commercial license**:

- internal evaluation and testing
- internal use without network distribution of modified versions
- modification and redistribution under AGPL-3.0
- creation of forks compliant with AGPL-3.0

---

## 3. Uses Requiring a Commercial License

A separate commercial license may be required for:

- embedding apiars into proprietary or closed-source products
- offering apiars-based functionality as part of a proprietary SaaS platform
- redistribution under non-AGPL terms
- avoidance of AGPL source disclosure obligations

Commercial licensing is offered separately by the author.

## 4. Trademark and Branding

The name **“apiars”** and associated branding are **not licensed** under AGPL-3.0.

- Forks and derivative works must not use the “apiars” name or branding
    
    without explicit written permission.
    
- Trademark rights are independent of the software license
    
    and may be licensed separately.

## 5. Intellectual Property Ownership

- Copyright and intellectual property rights remain with the author.
- AGPL-3.0 does not grant exclusivity.
- No ownership transfer occurs without a separate written agreement.

---

## 6. Dual Licensing Model

apiars follows a **dual-license model**:

- **Open Source License:** AGPL-3.0
- **Commercial License:** available on request for proprietary or SaaS use

This model is similar to approaches used by other enterprise-adopted

open-source projects (e.g. dual licensing with copyleft + commercial terms).

## 7. Governing Law (Commercial Licensing)

Commercial license agreements may be governed by:

- the laws of the State of Delaware (USA), or
- a mutually agreed EU member state

Jurisdiction is specified in the executed agreement.

---

## 8. Compliance Notes

- The AGPL-3.0 license text is unmodified.
- No additional restrictions are imposed beyond AGPL-3.0.
- Trademark restrictions do not modify license rights.
- The project is suitable for legal review and enterprise compliance processes.
